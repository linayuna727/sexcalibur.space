    <h3>What in the world is this?</h3>
    <p> sexcalibur.space is a site born from the sheer excellence of Casper Excalibur's magnificent products, much like the website turksigara.net.</p>
    <h3>What even is a "Casper Excalibur?"</h3>
    <p>Casper is a Turkish brand that sells computers like laptops, all-in-one devices and desktops. Excalibur is their sub-brand related to selling "gaming" products, which actually just outsources their models from a Chinese brand called "Thunderobot". For example their Casper Excalibur G770 model is identical with Thunderobot's 911 Air model.</p>
    <h3>S... excalbiur... sexcalibur!? WTFF????</h3>
    <p> The first time I got this laptop, one of my friends pointed out that putting an "s" before the device's name would spell "sex," and ever since then, I've been calling this laptop "Sexcalibur." It struck me as incredibly funny when I first heard it, and even though the joke might be a bit past its prime, considering my experiences with the product, I think we can add a little meaning to the joke with the existence of this site ‡´Æ À∂·µî ·µï ·µîÀ∂ ·Éê</p>
    <h3>Why do you dislike this device so much?</h3>
    <p>At first glance, it might seem like "oh, a gaming laptop, must be good," but trust me, it really isn't. It overheats way too much, Linux support is almost non-existent, and the battery life is truly, truly awful (it died and shut down 5 times during presentations at school). And it's not just limited to these issues; I can also add that Casper, as a brand, doesn't seem to care about the product they sell. I won't go into too much detail about these for now, but I plan to write a long blog post about it when I open a personal website. If I do, the first thing I'll do is link it here :3 </p>
    <h3>Why did you decide to open a site like this?</h3>
    <p>As a fan of these kinds of silly, unnecessary, but ultimately somewhat funny and entertaining domain names, I've always wanted to open a site like this. I also needed to get a domain for myself for a long time, and I thought if I bought a domain named after my laptop and opened a site like this, I could both learn about web hosting and create something nice that my friends could laugh at. So, I bought this domain and created this site the night I bought it. Honestly, I'm happy with the result, and I hope you like my site too ÀÉ ñ•¶ ÀÇ </p>
    <h3>Will you add anything else to the site?</h3>
    <p>Other than photos, I probably won't add anything else to the site; I think it's beautiful enough in its simple form.</p>
    <h3>How many photos are currently on the site?</h3>
    <p>There are currently <span id="photoCount" class="glow-purple">...</span> photos on the site.</p>
    <h3>I want to add a photo to the site</h3>
    <p>I'm always open to photo submission requests, and it would be really cool to see what the community has in mind! You can send a photo of your own Sexcalibur or just a random one from your gallery. <b>Just make sure it's not NSFW or illegal :3</b> I'll give credit for the photos you send, and if you want, I can handle the "sexcalibur.space" text myself :3 You can use the button below to reach me :3c </p>
